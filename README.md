# Brown
 > A simple library that makes dealing with Rust file system a breeze.
 ---

 Any one who has done any file system related project in Rust will know that the Rust file system (std::fs) is a bit wonky (so say the least).


 >**Brown** library exports helpful functions which gives you a very simple API for creating managin and manipulating files,folder etc in the current working folder.

 - It has zero dependencies.

 **For API documentation please check docs.rs/brown/0.0.6**
 ---
 ## Example

```rust


```

 **Please note that there is no difference between a "folder" and "directory". The are both same.**

Incase you have any issues with the library, let me know here [https://github.com/skillzaa/brown/issues](https://github.com/skillzaa/brown/issues)
